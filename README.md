# Taseen Uddin - cis4400homework

### The homework data set is from https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Arts-For-Transit-Metropolitan-Transportation-Autho/4y8j-9pkd

The purpose of this project is to show the number of art installations created over the years. This can be useful for tourists who are looking for some sites to visit and since everything in NYC is virtually connected by the subway, this can be utilized to show which stations have the most arts and when these installations were installed.
